# jsidiots-gulpfile
**A gulpfile.js for JS idiots (like me)**

This is a gulpfile that simply works, is easy to understand and aimed at webdevelopers starting a new website project - without the fancy stuff (yes, I am talking about you, Browserifiers).

**gulp commands**
* gulp: starts the server (using browsersync so that you can easily test your sites on all devices available)(
* gulp production: copies all the files you need for deployment into the build folder
* gulp clear: deletes the build folder
